This is media site api project using ExpressJs and mongoDb. This project can CRUD post, like and comment post, category and tag, user register and login.  If you use that project, you need to install npm from package.json. Because, node module and package-lock.json files is in gitignore. .env shoud be in git ignore because it has secret key. But this is testing project so i don't gitignore .env
